**CLARITY**  
Thanks Colin to make a plot of this question. I think the plot is a clear ratio plot at the first impression.
Something would better to be done in my mind, such as write the ratio in number at the border of different color sticks.
In general, the plot from Colin shows the tendency of the ratio of vehicle accidents from alcohol and others in a year.
 
**AESTHETHIC**  
The color is good for me to get the point. But I think it is better to set an alpha value for the orange to make it transparent because the accidents from alcohol is a part of all accidents.
The labels and labels size are good as well.

**HONESTY**  
I think the plot from Colin shows the tendency of the ratio of vehicle accidents from alcohol and others in a year clearly.
However, the log scale based on 10 is not necessary. Since it could make some misleading and exaggeration in visualization of ratio.
 
# FBB good point. So what would you suggest?
given the large number plotting in natural scale would make the DUI accidents fraction too small to see (or to see differences in it). What should be done is probably plot the total number of accidents and the fraction due to DUI in two separate plots. Side by side may also work, but the scales would have to be different, so having a scale on the left for the tot number of accident, from 0 to ~50,000 - possibly in log scale, and a scale on the right for the fraction of DUI accidents, the latter would need to go from 0 to ~0.001, given the number

10/10
